📌 This project was collaboratively researched, architected, and implemented by **Team SHESTORM**.

## 📌 Introduction

Voice fraud has evolved from simple scam calls into **AI-powered psychological attacks**.

By 2026:

* Voices can be cloned in seconds
* AI agents conduct full persuasive conversations
* Phone numbers are trivially spoofed
* Victims are manipulated emotionally, not technically

Yet most systems still ask:

> *“Is this voice fake?”*

❌ This question is no longer sufficient.

### ✅ Our Approach

We introduce a **Real-Time Audio Fraud Detection System** that focuses on **detecting fraudulent intent and manipulative behavior during live conversations**, before irreversible actions are taken.

## ❗ Problem Statement

### Why current solutions fail:

* Call blockers rely on static number lists
* Voice authentication fails against human scammers
* Fraud detection is reactive
* Users are expected to “be careful”

📌 Financial loss happens **within seconds** of answering a call.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

### Shift from *Identity → Intent*

Traditional systems focus on:

* Who is calling
* Whether the voice is real
* Whether the number is known

Our system focuses on:

* **Why** the caller is calling
* **What** they want the user to do
* **How** they manipulate emotions

📌 Numbers can be spoofed.
📌 Voices can be cloned.
📌 **Intent cannot hide.**

## 📞 How Fraud Appears in a Simple Call

Scam calls follow repeatable behavioral patterns:

* Authority impersonation (bank, police, government)
* Artificial urgency
* Isolation tactics (“don’t hang up”)
* Scripted conversation flow
* Forced financial actions (OTP, transfer)

Our system detects these patterns **in real time**, even on first-time calls.

## 🔍 How Fraud is Detected (Detailed Explanation)

### 1️⃣ Intent Detection — *What is being said*

Analyzes:

* Authority phrases (*bank, officer*)
* Urgency (*now, immediately*)
* Financial intent (*OTP, PIN*)
* Isolation (*don’t tell anyone*)

📌 Detection is based on **intent combinations**, not keywords.

### 2️⃣ Behavioral Analysis — *How it is said*

Detects:

* Rapid scripted speech
* Repetition
* Interruptions
* Dominant tone escalation

📌 Scammers follow scripts. Normal conversations adapt.

### 3️⃣ Emotional Manipulation Detection

Detects:

* Stress mismatch
* Fear induction
* Aggression inconsistent with role

📌 A “bank agent” using threats → **High-risk indicator**

## 🆚 Number-Based vs Conversation-Based Detection

### ❌ Number-Based

* Depends on blacklists
* Easily bypassed
* Fails on first contact

### ✅ Conversation-Based (Our System)

* Ignores phone numbers
* Analyzes live dialogue
* Detects fraud immediately

📌 Fraud is revealed by **conversation behavior**, not caller ID.


## 🆚 Competitive Advantage

| Competitor    | Strength       | Limitation           | Our Advantage                    |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Pindrop       | Voice liveness | Misses intent        | Intent + behavior                |
| BioCatch      | User behavior  | Post-event detection | Real-time manipulation detection |
| Nuance        | IVR security   | High latency         | Edge-ready system                |
| Call Blockers | Number lists   | Easily spoofed       | Conversation intelligence        |

## 🏁 Conclusion

Voice fraud is no longer an audio problem.
It is a **human manipulation problem**.

This system acts as a **Real-Time Conversation Firewall**, protecting users before trust is exploited.
