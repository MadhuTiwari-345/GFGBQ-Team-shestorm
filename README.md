# 📌 Problem Statement

## 🛑 Real-Time Audio Fraud Detection for Scam Prevention

Voice fraud has evolved from simple scam calls into **AI-powered psychological attacks**.

By 2026:

- Voices can be cloned in seconds  
- AI agents conduct full persuasive conversations  
- Phone numbers are trivially spoofed  
- Victims are manipulated emotionally, not technically  

Yet most systems still ask:

> “Is this voice fake?”

❌ That question is no longer enough.

---

# ✅ Our Approach

We introduce a **Real-Time Audio Fraud Detection System** that focuses on detecting **fraudulent intent and manipulative behavior during live conversations** — before irreversible financial actions occur.

Instead of identifying the caller, we identify the **conversation pattern**.

---

# 🧠 Core Philosophy

## Shift from *Identity → Intent*

Traditional systems focus on:

- Who is calling  
- Whether the voice is real  
- Whether the number is known  

Our system focuses on:

- **Why** the caller is calling  
- **What** they want the user to do  
- **How** they manipulate emotions  

📌 Numbers can be spoofed.  
📌 Voices can be cloned.  
📌 **Intent cannot hide.**

# 🔍 How Fraud is Detected

## 1️⃣ Intent Detection – *What is being said*

Analyzes:

- Authority phrases (bank, officer, government)  
- Urgency cues (now, immediately, final notice)  
- Financial triggers (OTP, PIN, transfer)  
- Isolation tactics (“don’t hang up”, “don’t tell anyone”)  

📌 Detection is based on **intent combinations**, not isolated keywords.

---

## 2️⃣ Behavioral Analysis – *How it is said*

Detects:

- Rapid scripted speech  
- Repetition patterns  
- Interruptions  
- Dominant tone escalation  

📌 Scammers follow scripts. Normal conversations adapt dynamically.

---

## 3️⃣ Emotional Manipulation Detection

Detects:

- Fear induction  
- Stress mismatch  
- Aggression inconsistent with role  

📌 A “bank agent” using threats = **High-risk indicator**

---

# 🆚 Detection Comparison

## ❌ Number-Based Detection

- Depends on blacklists  
- Easily bypassed  
- Fails on first-time calls  

## ✅ Conversation-Based Detection (Our System)

- Ignores phone numbers  
- Analyzes live dialogue  
- Detects fraud immediately  

📌 Fraud is revealed by **conversation behavior**, not caller ID.
